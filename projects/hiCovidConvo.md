HiCovidConvo is a deployed web application that my team and I developed for our ICS 314 class. The goal of the application was to implement a chat-bot to answer COVID-19 related questions and direct users to sites where they could find more information. 

The application was implemented using [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) React with Meteor for the front-end. The database was managed using MongoDB, and the chat-bot was created through the use of Google's cloud service, [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs). 



 I also gained real experience in using Semantic UI React with Meteor to create a deployed application.
