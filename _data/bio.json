    "summary": "Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Sydney Dempsey, a passionate and driven Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. During my time at the university, I served as President of the HKN Delta Omega Chapter and was honored as a Regents Scholar.

                My journey into the world of programming began in the 8th grade, and it was love at first sight when I was introduced to C. This early passion fueled my decision to pursue a career in Software Engineering. I started as a Front End Software Engineer at DataHouse Consulting, where I gained valuable experience with React and Vue.js.",
