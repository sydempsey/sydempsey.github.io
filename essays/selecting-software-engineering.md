## Where It All Began

Growing up, I could never figure out what it was that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I went back and forth between being a lawyer, a veterinarian, or a journalist. And then I had a friend convince me to join robotics with her in middle school. She was so excited and kept telling me about the programming language we would get to learn together. I was clueless, but followed along because she made it sound like a fantastic opportunity. And that was how I came to learn my first programming language: C. I continued with robotics throughout highschool and that is how I came to know my second language: Java. 


## Picking My Path

Although I knew I loved programming and critical thinking, I still didn’t know how to answer the one question that family and friends kept asking; “What are you going to study in college?” I knew that robotics was just a gateway to choosing a career in the STEM field, but I still wasn’t sure what I wanted to dedicate the rest of my life to. I kept switching my major between computer science and mechanical engineering my freshman year of college. I finally settled on Computer Engineering and it was one of the best decisions I have made.


## Applying What I’ve Learned

As a computer engineering student, I have taken both programming courses as well as classes on computer architecture. Out of all the required classes, the programming ones have been my favorite. They are what pushed me towards choosing a career in software engineering – and I’m finally able to answer the once dreaded question. Since the beginning of the year, I have been working with a local technology solutions company as an intern. Working on different projects and developing digital solutions has taught me more than any course I have taken so far. College has made me learn the fundamentals, but interning has given me the opportunity to take what I have learned and apply it to real-world problems.


## Looking Towards the Future

As I continue working, I’m excited because a career in software engineering is one that will constantly be full of learning new skills. As clients change and new technologies are developed, there will always be a new method or solution to learn. Aside from technical skills, I’m also looking forward to being a part of a team and learning practices from the experienced developers. Over the summer I’ve been able to work on projects that have sprung up due to COVID-19. Being able to help alleviate some of the stress that our community is facing is something that I want to continue doing for the rest of my career.
