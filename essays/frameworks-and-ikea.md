## Did Someone Say “Timber”?

Back in the day, if one wanted a new table, they would probably go outside and chop a tree down for the wood. They would need to design the table, cut up the lumber and sand it before beginning construction. Nowadays, most people will go to a store such as IKEA, pick out the perfect table, and take it home. They still need to read the instructions before assembling, but the overall build time is reduced significantly.


## Steep Slope

Using raw HTML and CSS to design a website is much like chopping down a tree, and building a table from scratch. You could achieve the same end product by utilizing a framework, or in the case of table making; purchasing from IKEA. User interface (UI) frameworks can be frustrating to learn, and definitely have a steep learning curve. But after the climb, the trail clears up and the development journey becomes a breeze. Future projects will require less time once you become comfortable with how to implement the specific modules and elements.


## Introduction to Frameworks

In past projects, I would spend hours fiddling around with my HTML and CSS files to make a page look exactly how I envisioned. I often found myself frustrated and spending most of my time trying to find a similar example on StackOverflow. That was until I was introduced to Angular JS earlier this year. It changed the way I started to approach frontend development. In comparison to Semantic UI, I found the Angular documentation easier to navigate. But learning a new Framework is almost like learning a new programming language. My knowledge of Angular did not help with familiarizing myself with Semantic UI. Just as building a table from IKEA may not be useful if I were to try and build a set of chairs. Overall, Frameworks provide a toolset that can be utilized to make designing websites and apps more efficient. Although they can be tedious to learn, such as reading an instruction manual, the time put in at the beginning saves a developer the frustration of starting from scratch.
