## Filling in the Blanks

I stared at the monitor in confusion. Every word that came out of my mentor’s mouth was going over my head. Why does each line have to end with a semicolon? Why does the variable type have to be declared? And don’t even get me started on the difference between conditional and assignment statements. My brain instantly started looking for patterns in every example I was shown. I could understand the math, and began filling in how the syntax and conditional statements handled the rest. 


## Preparation

My first mentor, Ross, was a stickler when it came to formatting and keeping track of previous versions of a program. As a high schooler, I felt that his methods were a little too tedious, but over time, I began to appreciate the lessons he taught me. He didn’t introduce us to GitHub, but he was preparing us for it with his own version of source control. He made sure that we would email him daily on any changes made, thoroughly comment our code, and that any changes to the program was shared among the team.


## A Virtual Mentor

I have followed everything Ross taught me about formatting and syntax until about two weeks ago, when I was introduced to ESLint; which is essentially Ross V2.0. I first found myself getting annoyed at the little red squiggly lines. It was almost as if my mentor was looking over my shoulder and correcting me before I could finish writing a line. ESLint has managed to be both a nuisance and very helpful at the same time. Some of the formatting criteria seemed a little excessive, such as the file needs to end with an empty line, or the space needed between a closing parantheses and an opening curly bracket. But I understand that following a specific coding standard is useful in the collaborative world that we are about to enter. Whether asking a peer for help, or consulting strangers on the internet, it’s hard to get the answer you’re looking for if your code is unorganized and unreadable.


## Foundation of Collaboration

Coding standards are a necessary etiquette that should be followed. Of course formatting may not be important to the computer, but if the program is built using a well-known foundation (formatting), then others will be able to focus on <i>what</i> the program is doing. Time will not be wasted trying to decipher where a function begins and ends. Coding standards may seem like a hassle, but they encourage collaboration and set up a fundamental foundation that allows developers to focus on what they’re trying to accomplish with the provided support.
