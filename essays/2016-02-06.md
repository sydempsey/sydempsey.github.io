## A Highly Flexible Development Language

Completing the introduction to JavaScript modules was my first experience with JavaScript (JS). I really enjoyed working through the small problems because I was able to slow down and observe the differences between JS and the other languages I already knew. As a computer engineering major, I have had experience with many of the basic languages such as C/C++, Python and Java. The best way I know how to describe JS is that it reminds me of a combination between Python and C++. Youâ€™re able to declare variables without specifying a type, similar to Python, but the rest of the syntax was very similar to C++. So far, JavaScript seems like a useful programming language for software development. Developing large scale projects is possible due to it being an object oriented language. There is also flexibility in declaring variables, allocating memory, and comparing values without having to worry about matching variable types. 


## Getting Comfortable With Being Uncomfortable

The athletic software engineering learning method has been stressful, but in a helpful way. I have been wary of coding interviews when applying for jobs after graduation. Typically, I like to be given a problem and take my time to think about it for awhile. Then, I start programming after I have outlined what I want to write in my head. The WODs are forcing me to get comfortable with thinking quickly and implementing faster than I normally would. Although they make me nervous, my hope is that I will become used to the pressure and be better prepared for working under pressure. I will most likely still be nervous during future coding interviews, but I can already tell that these WODs are going to help immensely.
